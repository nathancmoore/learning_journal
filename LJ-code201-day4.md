Today we learned a number of things, some of which are: the target blank attribute
for a link will cause that link to open in a new tab, instead of navigating away
from the current page. We also went back over block vs inline elements in css.
I noted down that position.static is the default positioning style for
elements. Also, that list-style-element: none can get rid of the bullet points
from an unordered list.

In the JS side of things we learned about functions, which seem to me to be
fundamental to all things JS. The two-person team project today was very
helpful for me; I really feel like I have a handle on functions so far.

Having fun!
