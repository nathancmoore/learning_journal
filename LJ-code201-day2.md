Today I learned that Google searches look specifically at nav and h1 tagged
content. This is important for me to know later, so that I can optimize
websites I build for maximum exposure. I also learned to NEVER EVER
USE INLINE CSS. Seems like solid advice. I thought I was pretty good with CSS,
but when I started the aesthetic part of the project that I turned in today,
I found myself feeling pretty helpless. I do fairly well with the html and js
code we've done so far, but css is my weakness. I'm going to try to work in a group
with people who both understand css are probably a little more "artsy" than I am.

Nick, I think you're doing a great job. No need for so much negative self-talk!

I hope everything goes perfectly with your new baby. Congratulations!
