Today we covered a ton of topics. One of those was "HTML elements," which are
special characters which start with & and appear as a special symbol on the page.
I also learned that the anchor tag, <a> can make just about anything into a link.
We also learned several new concepts for JS, including Conditional Statements,
logical operators, truthy and falsy -ness. We also learned about 3 kinds of loops,
though according to Nick one of those isn't very useful. Then we talked about
all things boxes in CSS. Margin-border-padding-content IN THAT ORDER!!!

The next thing we were taught was about new branches and pull requests and other
types of Git stuff. I found this very confusing. Luckily Brianna was willing
to walk me through all of it during the after-lunch work period. She was very
patient and helpful and I'm grateful to her.

This class is intense, but I think I'm up to the challenge. I'm really enjoying
JS the most. I think I'll probably really like Python, and that's what I'm
leaning towards for my 401 focus.

Thanks for another great day
