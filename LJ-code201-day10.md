I really enjoyed the presentations we watched today of the 401 students. It
was very cool to see them working on REAL projects for REAL customers. It also
gave me a good idea of the direction that my education is going. I'm excited to
expand my skills and start doing real shit.

Working with Dave was great. He was super helpful and I think that we worked
well together. I really enjoy pair projects, and I'm sure that I'll enjoy group
projects too.

Two weeks down, and I'm going strong!
