Today, we saw an example of git fetch, which I only partially understand at this point.
I also download the color-picker tool, which I'm sure will be very useful in the future.
We learned a ton about fonts, which I had never dreamed could be so in depth.
I always thought of fonts as a terribly mundane thing, but now I see that there's
a ton going on behind the scenes when it comes to fonts. Also, I must never use more
than 3 total fonts on a webpage, so as not to confuse and bother the user.
I also learned that github will allow us to publish our work to the REAL INTERNET,
in this case using a branch called gh-pages.

One week down, three to go! Let's GET IT
