Today was a really good day of work on the project. It's amazing what a little CSS
can do. We went from having what really looked like a work in progress into what is
now actually kind of resembling a game. It's amazing how just the aesthetic appearance
of the website changes my attitude towards it. I have a feeling that when this project is
done, I'm going to feel proud of the result.
