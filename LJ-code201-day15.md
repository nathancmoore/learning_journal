The git merge conflict exercise was a little terrifying. We made mistakes and
created unintended merge conflicts, which we then had to sort out. So we gained
valuable real-world experience of what to do, what not to do, and how to fix it
once you screw up. We'll have to remain vigilant not to mess up when working as a team in
the same file.
