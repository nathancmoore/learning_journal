On day 9, I got a little breather. The lab time allowed me to clean up some parts
of my fish cookie store from day 8. I finally had some time to put some real
thought and effort into the HTML and CSS layout. Many of the other lab times
were taken up with me working to understand the JS. It was welcome and I'm feeling
more confident with my CSS now, and I actually think my index.html for the
cookie store looks decent.
