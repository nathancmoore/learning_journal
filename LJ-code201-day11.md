Today's project was a lot of fun, but it was also very frustrating. I spent a lot
of time in the debugger trying to figure out why I kept getting duplicate images
back-to-back. I spent a lot of time poring over my code trying to solve the problem,
but it wasn't until I took a break from working on it, did something else for a few
hours and came back that I was able to solve the problem. I was simply running two
of my functions in the wrong order. The fix was so simple and quick to apply
that it made me feel silly for agonizing over it for so long, but I'm told that
this kind of dilemma is pretty normal in this field. Hooray for breaks!
