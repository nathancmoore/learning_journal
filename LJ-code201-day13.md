Today's lab went pretty smoothly when we were working on my code, but when the
time came to work on Michelle's, it turned out that she was super far behind
and we were basically working from scratch on her bus-mall project. At first,
I was a little frustrated with this, but as it turns out, starting from square one
is a great way for me to reinforce the ideas that I've learned, and also, teaching
material that I've just recently learned was a great way for me to wrap my mind
around these concepts and internalize them.

Since I got the idea of making Minesweeper in JS into my head, I haven't been
able to get it out. I'm pretty sure that I know enough to make this happen with
only the skills I've learned in this class, but I also have to be realistic about
the fact that I'm a beginner, and it's entirely possible and this passion project
is totally over my head and I'm just to ignorant to realize it. We'll see.
