Yesterday was a challenging day because we were no longer taking great strides
in the framework of our project; it's mostly all in place. As a result, most of the
changes and additions we made to the project were small, technical changes that
required a lot of brain power. As a result the change between days 1 and 2 was much
less dramatic than the change between days 0 and 1, so it felt a little like we
had been less productive, but that's only true if you count progress in terms of
lines of code. The game is better (read:actually kind of fun) now, and that makes
a big difference. I think we're actually gonna have a pretty sweet project when
this is all over with.
