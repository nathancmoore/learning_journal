Today we learned about objects, which seem to me to be the logical next step from
variables. They aren't arrays, but like arrays, they hold multiple values in the form
of key-value pairs. Fuctions can contain objects, objects can contain functions
and the blank-canvas-infinite-possibilities nature of coding is becoming more and
more clear to me. I'm excited to continue my education, and ultimately to work in this
field.

I had an error come up, and I worked with a TA on it, and she and I couldn't figure out
the problem. I had:

var totalsales = 0;

when we ran the debugger and went through the whole thing step by step, we were
getting totalsales as undefined right after that line ran. It was very confusing
and frustrating, and I wasn't able to solve it, so now for the first time,
my coding assignment wasn't done to my satisfaction by the due date.

I need to be vigilant to not fall behind.
