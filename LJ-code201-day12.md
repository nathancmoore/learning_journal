Today's lecture helped me a great deal, and I know have an inkling of how powerful
libraries are. I'll have the ability to just use massive blobs of code created by
people much smarter than me. I can see how libraries will save me a ton of time.

The lab was a nice break. Thankfully my bus-mall scripts were already working after
yesterday. Evidently that was not the case for many of my classmates, so they
spent the majority of lab time just finishing up yesterday's lab. I had the time
to fiddle around with my chart at a relaxed pace, and I'm pleased with how it turned out.
