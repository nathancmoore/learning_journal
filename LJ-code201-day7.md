Today we learned about constructor functions, and I think that they are
super fucking dope. I love them, and I love coding. Today's work was challenging,
but I feel like I did a good job and I'm optimistic about my future in this field

We also learned about table elements and their related sub-elements. I found it
difficult to visualize the way a table would look by just looking at the html.

Having fun, can't wait for more!
